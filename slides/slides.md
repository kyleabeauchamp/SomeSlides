- All systems show heterogeneity in loop and side chain packing in helix and nearby loop
- SETD1 HMM (see PSE file) looks most promising, with TYR packing of primary states similar to xtals 4FMU 4H12
- SETD1: states 0, state 6.  
- SETD1 takeaway: APO MD simulations recover binding poses
- Non hidden MSMs + PCCA are showing additional metastable states with backbone movements, but low (under one percent) populations and rare events (one visit)
- Problem: IMHO low population macrostates are rarely robust to differences in clustering etc.

- Proofreading will go a long way
- Remember the Simbios grant
